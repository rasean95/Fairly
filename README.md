### Fairly is a SaaS platform allowing talent acquisition teams to find the best talent faster and more efficiently for companies while saving time on recruiting & hiring. Fairly is an MVC and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, C#, and React code.

My role as a software engineer was to design and development the appintment scheduling feauture. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities:

• Constructed and optimized REST API endpoint controllers leveraging application services to facilitate appointment scheduling using C# within .NET, resulting in a reduction in response time for scheduling requests.

• Utilized the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to streamline appointment scheduling, resulting in reduced code complexity, improved code maintainability, and enhanced modularity.

• Designed an appointments page using React, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Axios, enabling administrators to organize and filter appointments by candidate, reducing loss of productivity and improving user experience. 

• Developed a secure appointment form to handle appointment management by integrating client-side and server-side validations and administrator authorization, effectively reducing scheduling errors.

• Developed and maintained an Azure SQL database to support appointment scheduling and management, utilizing Stored Procedures, Tables, User-Defined Types, and Constraints.

• Collaborated in a version control environment using Git with Visual Studio to manage and track source code changes to the application.

• Employed Agile Methodologies such as Scrum to deliver working software in increments, control work in progress, and ensure a continuous workflow.
