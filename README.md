### Fairly is a SaaS platform allowing talent acquisition teams to find the best talent faster and more efficiently for companies while saving time on recruiting & hiring. Fairly is an MVC and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, C#, and React code.

My role as a software engineer was to design and development the appintment scheduling feauture. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities:

• Developed a robust appointments dashboard using React and Bootstrap, featuring advanced filtering capabilities and integrated management features for the hiring admin team, reducing scheduling complexities.

• Implemented a custom form using Formik that handles appointment management, reducing scheduling errors.

• Built REST API endpoint controllers using C# and .NET, reducing response time for appointment scheduling.

• Designed and maintained an Azure SQL database with SQL Server to support data management.

• Collaborated in a version control environment using GitBash and Visual Studio for source code management.

• Leveraged Scrum for iterative software delivery and streamlined workflow.
