### Fairly is a SaaS platform allowing talent acquisition teams to find the best talent faster and more efficiently for companies while saving time on recruiting & hiring. Fairly is an MVC and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, C#, and React code.

My role as a software engineer was to design and development the appintment scheduling feauture. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities:

• Constructed a paginated appointments page using React.js, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Axios, enabling the hiring administrators to filter appointments by candidate and organize appointments more efficiently. 

• Designed a secure appointment management system by integrating a custom Formik form with client and server-side validations that handles form submissions, with authorized access for system and hiring administrators.

• Crafted and optimized REST API endpoint controllers using C# within .NET leveraging application services to facilitate appointment scheduling.

• Implemented Design Patterns in .NET, such as the Singleton pattern, to address recurring software design challenges and enhance reusability during development.

• Utilized the MVC ( Model-View-Controller ) pattern to streamline appointment scheduling, improve code maintainability, and enhance modularity.

• Applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using C# within .NET to construct a resilient and scalable appointment model that facilitated efficient scheduling and management processes.

• Developed and maintained an Azure SQL Server database to support appointment scheduling and management, utilizing stored procedures, tables, user-defined types, and constraints.

• Collaborated in a version control environment using Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio to manage and track source code changes to the application.

• Employed Agile methodologies such as Scrum to deliver working software in increments, control work in progress, and ensure a continuous workflow.
