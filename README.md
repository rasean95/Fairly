### Fairly is a SaaS platform allowing talent acquisition teams to find the best talent faster and more efficiently for companies while saving time on recruiting & hiring. Fairly is an MVC and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, C#, and React code.

My role as a software engineer was to design and development the appintment scheduling feauture. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities:

● Created a paginated list of active appointments using React.js, enabling the system and hiring administrators to filter appointments by client and organize appointments more efficiently.

● Constructed an appointments form with React.js, Formik, Yup, .NET, and T-SQL to authorize the system and hiring administrators to manage appointments and apply client and server-side data validations to maintain data integrity within the database.

● Developed and maintained a SQL server database to support appointment scheduling and management utilizing stored procedures, tables, user-defined types, and constraints.

● Designed and optimized API endpoint controllers in C# leveraging application services to facilitate appointment scheduling.

● Implemented design patterns in .NET such as the singleton to identify reusable solutions for software design problems occurring during application development.

● Collaborated in a version control environment using Git, Github, and Visual Studio to manage and track source code changes to the application.

● Conducted agile scrum methodologies such as sprints, daily stand-ups, code talks, and code reviews with peers to optimize workflow and deliver a high-value application.
